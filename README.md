## Project Overview

**Goodness Eats** is a user-centric website designed for a modern restaurant experience. The platform enables users to peruse an extensive menu, make reservations, and familiarize themselves with the restaurant's offerings and its expert culinary team. Focused on convenience and a holistic dining experience, Goodness Eats stands as the ideal choice for adults seeking quality, flavor, and a warm ambiance.

## Design Process

### Target Audience
- Adults who value a sophisticated dining experience are the primary audience for Goodness Eats.

### Primary Goal
- The site's main function is to facilitate effortless reservation placements, thereby boosting restaurant revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### User Stories
- As an adult, I want to view the menu so I can decide whether to visit the restaurant.

### Design Tools
- Adobe XD was employed for wireframe and mockup creation, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing design.

## Features

### Existing Features
- **Menu View**: Allows users to explore our diverse culinary offerings, aiding in their decision-making process.
- **Reservation System**: A streamlined system for placing reservations, capable of saving user information for future convenience.
- **Chef Information**: Features an engaging card design that showcases the accolades of our chefs, thereby attracting user attention and establishing trust in our culinary expertise.

### Features Left to Implement
- A shopping cart? where perhaps users can order delivery.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic content manipulation and enhancing user interactivity.
- **HTML**: Employed for structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Utilized for styling and visually organizing the website content.

## Testing

### Testing Process and Outcomes
- The website was rigorously tested across a range of screen sizes to ensure functionality and responsiveness. 
- All features were found to be fully operational and visually consistent on screen widths ranging from 1960px down to 500px.

### Specific Observations
- **Create Reservation Feature**: 
  - Functionality: This feature works seamlessly across screen widths from 1960px to 500px.
  - Visual Consistency: The sizing of elements within the 'Create Reservation' feature remains consistent and operational down to 500px. However, below 500px (down to 300px), while still functional, the sizing of some elements is slightly off, potentially affecting the visual appeal.

### Future Improvements
- **Responsiveness Enhancement**: Aiming to improve the visual layout of the 'Create Reservation' feature on screen widths below 500px, ensuring a uniformly excellent user experience across all devices.
